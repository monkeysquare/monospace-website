		<p style="font-size: 1.1em"><b>Thank you for your interest in Monospace 2011!</b></p>

		<p>We are extremely happy to have the opportunity to organize an event that we hope will bring together aficionados of open source software, .Net and, more importantly, the Mono framework. Monospace will be a three day event mixing two days of sessions and one day of open space and will take place in Boston in July 2011, although the exact date hasn't been finalized yet. We plan to charge around $250 per ticket to cover our costs, plan for you to have a great time in Austin and to promote community events around Mono throughout the year.</p>

		<p>We have very fond memories of the first Monospace and we hope to create new and better experience this time around. We certainly hope you will a part of this and we will be sure to keep you updated as we progress in our organization of this conference.</p>

		<p>Thank you,</p>
