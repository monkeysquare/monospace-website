		<p style="font-size: 1.1em"><b>A big, big change!</b></p>

		<p>The Monospace conference just got bigger! First of all, we are moving the location to Boston. Second, the date will now be in July because, well, Boston gets a bit cold in October. Now, the reason for this change is simple: all the Mono engineers will be in Boston during this time and will be available during the conference. To us, this is big. We wanted to revive Monospace to give everyone a chance to learn and participate in discussions and we believe that there will be no better way to do that than to have all the Mono team present, giving talks and mingling with the attendees. This is going to be a huge opportunity for the community!</p>

		<p>We are aware that July will be on us soon and we are furiously working towards securing a location and an exact date. We will let you know as soon as possible!</p>

		<p>Thank you!</p>
