			<h1>Monospace 2012 - Coming October 17-19</h1>
			<p>Monospace is the official cross platform and open-source .NET conference.  Want to learn more about developing for the iPhone, Android, Mac, and *nix platforms using .NET technologies?  How about developing games or learning more about open-source projects using .NET technologies?  Monospace has provided an annual venue to collaborate, share, and socialize around these topics and more.</p>
			<p>Monospace provides developers a unique look at running their applications across all the platforms using Microsoft's .NET Framework by focusing on the Mono framework and open source .NET technologies. We will start with 2 days of talks and sessions, aiming to teach the attendees about the various technologies and innovations that currently exists. We will then end with a one day open space unconference where dialogs and conversations will help kick start the next wave of open source projects that will help the community remain competitive.</p>
			<p>A call for speakers and registration will open soon with an all new website design, but in the mean time for more info feel free to visit our <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/monospace-conf/" title="Monospace 2012 Lanyrd Page" target="_blank">Lanyrd page</a>!</p>
