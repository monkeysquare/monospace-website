		<p>If you think that Monospace is only about Mono, you’re mistaken. We’re working on changing that perception!</p>

		<p>Monospace is the official cross platform and open-source .NET conference. Want to learn more about developing for the iPhone, Android, Mac, and *nix platforms using .NET technologies? How about developing games or learning more about open-source projects using .NET technologies? Monospace has provided an annual venue to collaborate, share, and socialize around these topics and more. Monospace is more than just about Mono, it's geared toward the whole .NET open-source ecosystem. We have exciting news to share about that at the conference as well!</p>

		<p>Monospace is a Monkey Square joint, all proceeds help the .NET open-source ecosystem!</p>

		<p>If you or your company is interested in sponsoring, you can view our sponsorship packages here: http://monospace.us/monospace_sponsor_packages.pdf, if you can't find something suitable for your organization, please contact us[info@monospace.us]. We will be happy to negotiate with you for other opportunities.</p>

		<p>You will not want to miss this event, lots of news to share and a great speaker lineup. Hope to see you there!</p>

		<p>Cheers,</p>
		<p>The Monkey Square Team<br/>http://monkeysquare.org/</p>
