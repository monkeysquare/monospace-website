						<h3>Join Us for Monospace 2011</h3>
						<p>Monospace provides developers a unique look at running their applications across all the platforms using Microsoft's .NET Framework by focusing on the Mono framework and open source .NET technologies.  We will start with 2 days of talks and sessions, aiming to teach the attendees about the various technologies and innovations that currently exists.  We will then end with a one day open space unconference where dialogs and conversations will help kick start the next wave of open source projects that will help the community remain competitive.</p>

							<p>Scott Olson has spent the past 18 years building software and advising clients on the potential of software and mobility. He is a contributing writer for iPhone Life magazine, technical editor of iPad in the Enterprise: Developing and Deploying Business Applications, and his forthcoming book is tentatively titled Cross-Platform Mobile Development for the Enterprise.   He leads the development team at ITR Mobility, and throughout his career has worked with many of the Fortune 500 companies including Best Buy, Target Corporation, Medtronic, and Prudential Financial. He believes that what is happening in the mobile software industry today will change the way people write and use software.

							<div class="talk">Cross-platform Mobility: The Rise of Mono in the Enterprise</div>
							<p>The introduction of the iPhone, iPad, and Android has changed the mobile computing landscape, and the impact these devices are making on corporate IT is no less significant. The mobile revolution is all about the apps, and expectations of both device capabilities and user experience have profoundly changed.  Consumer owned devices are entering the workplace at an unprecedented level, and rather than the IT department dictating device choice the average worker is driving adoption.  This seismic shift in the power structure of enterprise IT is creating a huge demand for cross-platform development solutions.  CEO’s and CIO’s across industries have made significant investments in C# and .NET technologies.  Mono empowers them to bring these technologies to new platforms, and is poised to make a huge impact in the enterprise.</p>

							<div class="talk">Asynchronous programming made simple through messaging</div>
							<p>Multi core systems are everywhere these days. How do we adapt our designs to fit this future?
							There are several techniques out there for utilizing multi core systems in our applications. There
							is the Task Parallel Library, Parallel Linq and even plain old fork and join. However these are
							all techniques that will help you work with parallel execution in a synchronous setting. Mixing
							synchronous and parallel is no match made in heaven and can become quite painful. So why are we
							still sticking to synchronous designs?</p>

							<div class="talk">Using MongoDB on Mono</div>
							<p>In late 2010 10gen began working on their own driver to officially support using MongoDB from .NET on Windows. The community promptly began submitting patches to make it work in Mono. Today the driver works quite well in Mono.</p>
							
							<p>This talk will include a brief introduction to MongoDB, but will focus on interacting with it in Mono via the official 10gen driver. Techniques for handling business logic in application code, such as LINQ will be discussed. This will be a very code centric talk.</p>

							<div class="talk">Functional Async UI Programming using Reactive Extensions and ReactiveUI</div>
							<p>For many modern UI applications, managing multiple asynchronous calls
							whether they be web service calls or calculations in the background,
							is now a de-facto requirement; however, our tools and frameworks for
							doing so, Events, are quite primitive and make even simple
							compositions into complex state management. The Reactive Extensions
							for .NET greatly simplifies this task, by allowing you to compose
							event streams in a declarative fashion. On top of Rx, I've built a
							MVVM framework called ReactiveUI, that allows you to elegantly combine
							changing Model or ViewModel properties into composite properties to
							build testable UIs with less effort, even simulating a series of
							events instantly in a unit test runner using the virtual time
							scheduler features of Rx.</p>

Arne has been involved in large scale web applications and distributed systems for over 10 years and has been a C# developer for the last 7 years. His particular focus is on parallel and asynchronous programming and how to make it writing code that scales over multiple processors and servers more accessible and intuitive.</p>
							<div class="talk">Forget about Threads: Tasks, Asynchronous Methods &amp; Coroutines</div>
							<p>Asynchronous programming using callbacks and continuation passing styles have been around in .NET since the start, but have always made code harder to read and comprehend. Coroutines, as implemented in MindTouch's DReAM framework or the async method and await constructs coming in C# 5.0, aim to make asynchronous programming simpler by retaining sequential programming workflows, while allowing async suspension of code waiting for completions. This talk will present a brief overview of available asychrony patterns, their pros and cons, and delve into a tutorial on how to use either DReAM coroutines or C# 5.0 asynchronous methods, as well as how the two implementations compare and contrast. Learn how to write code that will take advantage of multi-core architectures and avoid blocking on I/O without having to touch a thread or a lock statement in the process.</p>

							For the past 13 years she has been involved in the development of

							Winforms and gluezilla to embedding browser engines and bindings.
							Currently, she spends her time hacking on Moonlight, maintaining
							browser bindings and working with her SoC student to improve C++
							support on Mono.</p>
							<div class="talk">Mono and C++ - Updates from the interoperability world</div>
							<p>One of Mono's long-standing limitations is the C++ interoperability,
							or lack thereof. Traditionally, using a C++ library from C# involved
							creating a C glue library that served as middleman, proxying all the
							calls into C++ and back. by creating a flat level of C calls between
							the two, we lose, among other things, information in terms of object
							hierarchy, the ability to subclass, and end up with a rather large
							list of cryptic pinvokes - ugly code, in short.</p>

							<div class="talk">Problems and Solutions for Mobile App Developers</div>
							<p>This talk will present three recurring problems faced by mobile developers while building their apps
							and will focus on code patterns and strategies used to solve them. The selection is based on
							problems the presenter continuously encounters and have been identified as those that prevent him
							from having the most fun.</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>* The Disconnected Internet Device</li>
								<li>* Minimizing Code with Multiple UIs and Platforms</li>
								<li>* Discovering and Squashing Bugs</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>Even though there are only three topics, each one could be an entire talk on its own. This means
							that this talk will be a whirlwind through ideas and practical solutions. There will be an emphasis
							on mobile app development using the Mono platform since that seems to be all the presenter can think
							about these days</p>

							<p>Monospace will be held at the Microsoft NERD Center located in Boston, MA one of the most historic cities in the United States.

							<p>We are still compiling information about things to see in Boston.  Once it's ready, we'll add it to the list to the right.</p>
							<h4>Getting Around Boston</h4>
							<p>There's plenty of options for getting around Boston, but we recommend getting a <a href="" title="Charlie Card">Charlie Card</a> for the weekend or week that you'll be in Boston.  That way, no matter which <a href="http://www.mbta.com/"><abbr title="Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority">MBTA</abbr></a> system you use, you'll be covered.  You can buy a Charlie Card at any MBTA bus or train station.</p>
