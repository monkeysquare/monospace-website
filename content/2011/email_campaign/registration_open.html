		<p style="font-size: 1.1em"><b>Monospace 2011 registration is open!</b></p>

		<p>Registration for Monospace is open! Come check out our new website and if you're up to it, grab a seat and <a href="http://monospace.us">register</a> for the conference.</p>

		<p>You may or may not have heard the news but just in case you haven't, here's the current situation regarding Mono. Miguel and his team have been laid off by AttachMate during the reorganization that followed its purchase of Novell. Not one to be brushed aside so easily, Miguel secured some financing and launched <a href="http://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, a new startup dedicated to all things Mono, and brought the entire crew on board. You can read the whole story on <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-16.html">Miguel's blog</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Miguel and company will be at Monospace 2011, so be sure to come by and have take a seat in the conversation that will join the .Net and Mono open source communities.</p>
