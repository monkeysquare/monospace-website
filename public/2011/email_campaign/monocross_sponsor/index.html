		<p>MonoCross is the open-source MVC pattern for cross-platform enterprise mobile development built on Mono/C# and .NET. The MonoCross pattern is currently being used in seven Fortune 500 companies, including the largest iPad deployment of 2010. ITR Mobility has been developing mobile strategies for enterprise clients since long before the “App Store” was even a concept, and with that experience in hand, we’re proud to sponsor the MonoCross project.</p>
