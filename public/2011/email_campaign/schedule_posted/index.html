		<p>Monospace 2011 is almost around the corner and it was time to finally decide on a schedule. We have tried our best to put related talks one after another to form some kind of track, especially for the Mobile and Asynchronous themes. We also have two specialized talks (XAML Presentation Patterns and A Tour of the F# Compiler) that have been set in a smaller room. These two talks are advanced and geared towards people who want to go deep into those subjects.</p>
		<p>But here's the thing: there are only two talks officially scheduled in that small room and for the remainder of the time the room would be empty, so we'll put a sign up sheet with time slots. If you'd like to present something, anything related to Mono and open source on .Net, come put your name on the sheet and the title of your talk in a time slot of your choice.</p>

		<p>Go checkout the schedule on the <a href="http://monospace.us">website</a> and Let us know what you think by replying to this email. The event is coming soon and we can't wait to meet you all!</p>
